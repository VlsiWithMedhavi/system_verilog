# SYSTEM VERILOG code for Digital Electronic circuits

##### Github Repository: https://github.com/VlsiWithMedhavi/system_verilog

## Description
This github repository consists of system erilog codes along with their respective *testbenches* for *Digital Electronic circuits* which are modeled, simulated and tested in *Modelsim* simulator.  
It also contains some logisim files in order to get hardware understanding of basic circuits. 

All the modules and submodules are tested correctly with all plausible input arguments in order to get accurate results for correct functionality of circuits. Hence please fell free to make pull requests for the same.

New suggestions and error corrections to code are welcomed.
